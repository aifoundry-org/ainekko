# Our Vision

OWN YOUR OWN AI: private, composable and controllable AI systems at the enterprise level. 

# Our Mission

We are a community of practitioners building open-source private, composable and controllable AI systems, aiming to make local models deployment easier and more effective at different levels.

By collaborating on such system standards for everyone, we aim to reduce the complexity of the AI industry in general. 

We desire to see the industry aligned on the principles of how those systems are structured, yet allowing every company to customize its own engine or system, configured the way each specific company needs it. 

Therefore, we foster and build projects which can become engineering building blocks of such local deployment systems.

We support practitioners willing to benefit from AI in their work and life, specifically models and their fine-tuning and deployment, such as:

- Software engineers building with open source AI technologies

- Data engineers handling data for models training, fine-tuning and deployment in different ways

- Academic researchers working on the latest techniques of models fine-tuning, such as continuous training, and models local usage, such as quantization

- Funky hardware companies designing semiconductors, processors and chips, and optimizing software for better hardware utilization

- CTOs defining their companies technical strategy

- CIOs strategically looking for a new infrastructure and not limiting to the existing one

# Our Values

1. Openness:  transparency and shareability are foundational for effective collaboration.

2. Integrity: honesty, ethics, and follow-through are necessary to foster trust between employees, customers, and our community.

3. Empathy: we are mindful and curious about other people’s motivations and ideas, and help each other with compassion and kindness.

4. Cooperation: always seeking win-win solutions and mutually beneficial outcomes
