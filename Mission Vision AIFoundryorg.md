“OWN YOUR OWN AI”

# Our Mission

We are a community of practitioners building an open-source composable AI ecosystem. By collaborating on standards for everyone, we aim to reduce the complexity of the AI industry. 

# Our Vision

Our long-term vision is to help the industry evolve to a structure where model training and deployment for any company are open, transparent, and concise. We desire to see the industry aligned on the principles of how those systems are structured at a high level from which every company can deploy its own engine or system, configured the way each specific company needs it. This approach will lower risks and improve AI results for all companies and practitioners.

Therefore, we foster, build and support projects which can become engineering building blocks of such training and deployment systems.

Our community engages practitioners willing to benefit from AI in their work and life, specifically in models fine-tuning and deployment, such as:

- Software engineers willing to use AI but still lost in its complexity

- Data engineers handling data for models training, fine-tuning and deployment in different ways

- Researchers and reasearch labs working on the latest techniques of models fine-tuning, such as continuous training

- Hardware companies contributors working on designing software for better chips utilization

- CTOs defining their companies technical strategy and caring about data privac and models deployment control and composability

- Strategy and Transformation leads designing their companies 'whats' and 'hows'
  
- Investors focused on deep tech open source AI-backed products

# Our Values

1. Openness:  transparency and shareability are foundational for effective collaboration.

2. Integrity: honesty, ethics, and follow-through are necessary to foster trust between employees, customers, and our community.
